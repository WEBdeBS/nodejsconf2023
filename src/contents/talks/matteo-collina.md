In 2012, this tiny community group "WEBdeBS" run the first conference ever on Node.js. I was there in the room, watching great speakers present a future in technology that was so innovative that blew my mind. No one would have thought that the bumblebee could fly, but now Node.js is installed on every developer machine - yours too! In this talk, we are going to go through the story of Node.js, what were the key moments in Node.js history, and what's the state of the project today. We will also cover all the key features we shipped between 2012 and now, and why developing Node.js applications in 2023 can be so much better!
