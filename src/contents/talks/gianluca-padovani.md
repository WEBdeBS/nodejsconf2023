In recent years, our applications have been increasingly transforming into distributed systems, such as microservices, serverless, and edge computing.

This migration brings many benefits, but it also presents challenges in terms of monitoring, tracing, and logging, sometimes turning what used to be straightforward into an absolute nightmare.
