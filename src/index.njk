      <p>
        Behind this conference there is WEBdeBS - the name stands for Web
        Developers Brescia, the city in Italy we all come from - a group of
        people sharing a strong passion for everything related to the web (but
        not only).
      </p>
      <p>
        We meet from time to time to talk about software, software development,
        frameworks, programming, web/mobile and client/server technologies, and
        social media communication. Geek's talk basically! (but not only).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes we meet to share presentations, some other to chat till night,
        drinking a pirlo (a typical local drink) or a beer.
      </p>
      <p>
        This conference is born with this spirit:
        <strong>
          not strictly a commercial or promotional event, but rather a gathering
          organized using time, passion and willingness taken away from our
          daily working life.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p><strong>From the community for the community.</strong></p>

    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>
      Nodejsconf is a community conference intended for networking and
      collaboration in the developer community. We value the participation of
      each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable
      and fulfilling experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to
      other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events,
      whether officially sponsored by Nodejsconf or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers,
      exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any WEBdeBS event are required to
      conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this
      code throughout the event (online and/or in-person).
    </p>
    <h2>The short version</h2>
    <p>
      No type of harassment, in any form, towards other people will be tolerated
      during every single event organized and sponsored by the association.
    </p>
    <p>
      All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
      including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
      imagery are never appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
      professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
      exclusionary jokes are never appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference
      without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>
    <h2>Our Pledge and Standards</h2>
    <p>
      We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in
      our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
      age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex

      education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
      caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open,
      welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
    </p>
