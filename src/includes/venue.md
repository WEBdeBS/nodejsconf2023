## The venue
Centro Pastorale Paolo VI a BresciaThe conference will be held at Centro Paolo VI in Brescia, a large and modern congress center located within a beautiful palace from the 1500, close to the city historical center.

We chose this venue because of its position, easy to reach both by train and by car, but primarily for the size of its meeting rooms, with the aim to accommodate as many attendees as possible.

The main room can seat up to 200 people, there are also other spaces which suits well for chatting, discussions and feedbacks. The beautiful cloister is going to host (weather permitting) lunch and coffee breaks.

Attendees facilities
Here some services we have agreed with the congress center:

internet wi-fi connection
free parking during the event (250 spaces circa)
dining agreement
Lunch Break
We have agreed with the conference center a special lunch price of €18 per person. The lunch consists of a buffet, a main dish, a dessert, mineral water and coffee. For organizational reasons we ask the attendees who wants to take advantage of this offer to reserve their seats (reservations are closed) before the event.

For whom who wants to have a small walk there are some good bar, restaurants, kebab and bakeries near the conference center. There is also a city park Parco dell'Acqua suitable, whether permitting, for a tasty pic-nic surrounded by fish paintings, big carps swimming in the park's lake, museums, and centenarians trees.
