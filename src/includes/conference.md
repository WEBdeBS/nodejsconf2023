Behind this conference there is WEBdeBS - the name stands for Web Developers Brescia, the city in Italy we all come from - a group of people sharing a strong passion for everything related to the web (but not only).

We meet from time to time to talk about software, software development, frameworks, programming, web/mobile and client/server technologies, and social media communication. Geek's talk basically! (but not only).

Sometimes we meet to share presentations, some other to chat till night, drinking a pirlo (a typical local drink) or a beer.

This conference is born with this spirit: **not strictly a commercial or promotional event, but rather a gathering organized using time, passion and willingness taken away from our daily working life.**

**From the community for the community.**
