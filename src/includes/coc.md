# ðŸ¤² Code of Conduct

Nodejsconf is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community. We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.

Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by Nodejsconf or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any WEBdeBS event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event (online and/or in-person).

## The short version

No type of harassment, in any form, towards other people will be tolerated during every single event organized and sponsored by the association.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are never appropriate.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are never appropriate.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## Our Pledge and Standards

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

*   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
*   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
*   Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
