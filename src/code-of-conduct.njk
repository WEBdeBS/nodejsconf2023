  <p>Nodejsconf is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community. We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.</p>
  <p>Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by Nodejsconf or not.</p>
  <p>To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any WEBdeBS event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event (online and/or in-person).</p>
  <h2 id="the-short-version">The short version</h2>
  <p>No type of harassment, in any form, towards other people will be tolerated during every single event organized and sponsored by the association.</p>
  <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are never appropriate.</p>
  <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are never appropriate.</p>
  <p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
